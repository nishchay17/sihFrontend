          The ‘Sikkim state scheme portal’ is aimed at a single point of access
          to all the schemes offered by the Government of Sikkim through its
          constituent departments. We provide access to current, complete, and
          accurate information related to all the schemes provided by the
          government.
          <br /> We here provide a platform to the citizens where they can view
          all the schemes offered by the government and those for which they are
          eligible. In times of COVID-19 pandemic, we bring forth a hassle-free
          process to apply for the schemes (under whose eligibility criteria you
          fall) while staying safe at home.
